# SMS Spam Detection

This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to detect spam messages in SMS text data. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a supervised learning algorithm to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham).

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "SMS Spam Collection" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains a collection of 5,574 SMS messages, labeled as spam or ham. The dataset can be downloaded from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection).

The dataset file (`sms_spam_dataset.csv`) contains two columns:
- `label`: Indicates whether the message is spam (1) or ham (0).
- `text`: The actual text content of the SMS message.
